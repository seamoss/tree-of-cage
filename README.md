# Tree of Cage

Tree of Cage is a tabletop board game of destiny, chaos, and Nic Cage archetypes.

Each player begins as a humble Proto-Cage (early career roles like Valley Girl Randy or Raising Arizona H.I.) and climbs the branching tree of Nicolas Cage personas.

Through bizarre Scenes, wild PvP duels, and evolving archetypes, players race to ascend into Cage Prime - either as the noble Oscar Cage or the unhinged Meme God Cage.

## How It Works

- **Start Small** - Choose a Proto-Cage with base stats like Madness, Charm, Rage, Luck, and Gravitas.
- **Face Scenes** - Draw film-inspired challenges (Plane Hijack, Romantic Monologue, NOT THE BEES!) and roll dice to succeed.
- **Evolve** - Collect tokens to climb the tree into Blockbuster and Mythic archetypes (e.g., Con Air’s Cameron Poe, Face/Off’s Castor Troy, Mandy’s Red Miller).
- **Duel Other Cages** - Once Blockbuster, challenge rivals in PvP showdowns; swap identities, steal tokens, or unleash Cage Rage.
- **Win by Enlightenment** - First to reach Mythic tier and complete the final trial becomes Cage Prime and wins the game.

## Highlights

- **Branching Paths** - Each starting role can evolve into multiple directions, randomized for replayability.
- **Absurd PvP Powers** - Swap identities (Face/Off), burn cards (Ghost Rider), or duel multiple players (Mandy).
- **Two Paths to Victory** - Gravitas and tragedy (Oscar Cage) or pure madness (Meme God Cage).
- **Lightweight Playtest Kit** - All core rules, archetypes, and scenes fit into a spreadsheet + printable rulebook.
