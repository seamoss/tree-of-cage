# **Tree of Cage – Instructions (Draft v1.0)**

## Overview

Welcome to **Tree of Cage**, a board game of destiny, chaos, and Nic Cage archetypes. Players begin as humble Proto-Cages and climb the **Tree of Archetypes**, evolving into increasingly bizarre and powerful personas. Along the way you’ll face Scenes, duel rival Cages, and wrestle with your own Madness. The ultimate goal is to ascend into **Cage Prime** — either as **Oscar Cage** (dramatic gravitas) or **Meme God Cage** (unhinged absurdity).

## Components

- **Archetype Cards** (Proto, Blockbuster, Mythic)
- **Scene Deck** (challenges from Cage films)
- **Cage Tokens** (track progress; coins, buttons, or beans work)
- **Madness Counters** (track chaos buildup)
- **Tree Board** (shared diagram showing branching paths; tokens mark your place)
- **Turn Log (optional)** – a sheet to track results

## Players

- **2–6 players** (best at 4)
- **45–90 minutes** per game

## Setup

1. **Choose Archetypes:** Each player selects a unique **Proto-Cage** to start (or assign randomly).
2. **Give Starting Stats:** Each Proto comes with Madness, Charm, Rage, Luck, Gravitas values.
3. **Tokens:** Each player begins with **0 Cage Tokens**.
4. **Scene Deck:** Shuffle and place face-down in the center.
5. **Tree Board:** Place player markers at their chosen Proto-Cage root.

## Turn Sequence

Each turn, a player does the following:

1. **Draw Scene** → Flip top Scene card.
2. **Attempt Challenge** → Roll 1d6 + required Stat (Madness, Charm, Rage, Luck, Gravitas).
   - Compare to Scene’s Target number.
   - **Success:** Gain Cage Tokens / rewards.
   - **Fail:** Suffer penalty (lose Tokens, gain Madness, etc.).
3. **Optional Evolution** → Spend **3 Cage Tokens** to evolve into a **Blockbuster Archetype** on your branch (decide via coin flip/randomizer if two branches exist).
4. **Check for PvP** → If Blockbuster or higher, you may challenge another player to a **Duel** once per turn.

## Scenes (PvE Encounters)

Scenes represent moments from Cage’s films.

- Each Scene has: **Stat**, **Target**, **Success**, **Fail**.
- Example:
  - *Plane Hijack (Con Air)* — Rage 5+ → Success: +1 Token; Fail: -1 Token.
- Some Scenes trigger **wild effects** like *Face/Off* (swap roles) or *Cage Rage* (burn cards).

## PvP Duels

When at **Blockbuster tier or higher**, you may challenge another player:

1. **Choose Opponent & Stat** → Challenger selects the stat used.
2. **Roll Off** → Both roll 1d6 + chosen stat.
3. **Result:**
   - Higher total wins.
   - Tie → both suffer Scene fail effect.
4. **Rewards:**
   - Default: Winner steals 1 Token.
   - Or: Apply Archetype’s **special PvP power**.
   - Loser always loses 1 Token.

Example:

- *Castor Troy (Face/Off)* wins a duel → may **swap Archetypes** with opponent.

## Archetype Tiers

1. **Proto-Cage (Roots)** → Starting archetypes; weak but quirky.
2. **Blockbuster Cage (Trunk)** → Iconic 90s roles; unlock PvP combat.
3. **Mythic/Unhinged Cage (Branches)** → Supernatural or absurd archetypes; abilities often chaotic.
4. **Cage Prime (Apex)** → Victory condition.

## Victory – Ascending to Cage Prime

To win, you must:

1. Reach the **Mythic tier**.
2. Gather at least **8 Tokens**.
3. Attempt the **Enlightenment Trial**:
   - Roll your highest stat 3 times in a row, OR
   - Pay **10 Tokens** to buy destiny.
4. On success, declare yourself **Cage Prime**:
   - **Oscar Cage** → victory by Gravitas.
   - **Meme God Cage** → victory by Madness.

The first to ascend wins.

## Special Rules

- **Cage Rage:** If you roll a natural 1 on a Madness check, trigger Cage Rage → lose 1 Token, but burn (discard) the Scene card.
- **Face/Off Swap:** When triggered, swap Archetypes with opponent (take their stats and ability).
- **Mythic Surge:** Mythic archetypes may trigger once per turn at start/end (e.g., extra rolls, scene destruction).
- **Madness Overload:** If a player accumulates **6 Madness**, they collapse into chaos → devolve 1 tier down the tree.

## Example Game (4 Players)

- Player A starts as Randy → evolves into Ben Gates → duels Cameron Poe and steals tokens.
- Player B starts as H.I. → evolves into Poe → gets Rage dueling powers.
- Player C starts as Ronny → evolves into Castor Troy → swaps Archetypes with Poe, creating chaos.
- Player D starts as Ben Sanderson → evolves into Charlie Kaufman → redraws Scenes to stall.
- Endgame: Player D climbs to **Robin Feld (Pig)** → wins Enlightenment Trial by Gravitas → becomes **Oscar Cage**.

## Designer Notes

- The **Tree branches** and **Scene Deck** can be randomized each game for variety.
- Balance comes from **stat spreads** and **token economy** (3 tokens to evolve, 8–10 to win).
- PvP is **optional but spicy** — heavy dueling games tend toward Meme God wins; light dueling favors Oscar Cage.
